//res.status(500).json({message: "Error"}) //JSON code being sent down - good for API

// .status(200) is implied, doesn't need ot be explicitly stated

//res.download("server.js") //downloads file directly to harddrive

//Send some json or render a file
//res.render('index')
//EJS is a view engine , I don't think this applies because I am using React front end
